01 Years ago when I was younger
02 I kinda’ liked a girl I knew.
03 She was mine, and we were sweethearts,
04 That was then, but then it’s true
05
06 I’m in love with a fairytale
07 Even though it hurts.
08 ‘Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind;
09 I’m already cursed
10
11 Every day we started fighting,
12 Every night we fell in love.
13 No one else could make me sadder,
14 But no one else could lift me high above
15
16 I don’t know what I was doing
17 But suddenly we fell apart.
18 Nowadays I cannot find her.
19 But when I do we’ll get a brand new start
20
21 I’m in love with a fairytale
22 Even though it hurts.
23 Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind;
24 I’m already cursed
25
26 She’s a fairytale
27 Yeah
28 Even though it hurts.
29 Cause I don’t care if I lose my mind;
30 I’m already cursed
